**CoNeX** is a powerful and flexible Python framework for building, simulating, and experimenting with spiking neural networks, with a focus on modeling cortical structures. Built on `PyTorch` and `Pymonntorch`, CoNeX provides a high-level API to design complex network architectures inspired by the brain's neocortex, such as cortical layers and columns. 

The framework is designed for researchers and developers in computational neuroscience to easily create and manage intricate models, define custom neuronal behaviors, and apply various learning rules like Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP).

## Modules and Functionality

### `conex.behaviors`

This module contains the building blocks for defining the dynamics of the network. Each behavior is a class that can be attached to a network object (like a `NeuronGroup` or `SynapseGroup`) to confer specific functionality.

  * **`network`**: Defines network-wide dynamics.
      * `TimeResolution`: Sets the simulation time step (`dt`). 
      * `Payoff`: A base class for defining reward/punishment signals. 
      * `Dopamine`: Models the effect of dopamine as a neuromodulator, influenced by the payoff signal.
      * `numenta.voting`: Inter-column voting and consensus for the Thousand Brains Theory (`ColumnVoting`, `ConsensusNetwork`, `SDROverlap`). 
  * **`neurons`**: Defines the behavior of individual neurons.
      * `neuron_types`: Includes LIF, ELIF, and AELIF neuron models.  These models define the fundamental voltage dynamics of a neuron.
      * `dendrite`: Models dendritic compartments (proximal, distal, apical) and computes the input current `I` by summing their contributions. 
      * `axon`: Propagates spikes from a neuron to its connected synapses, handling transmission delays. 
      * `homeostasis`: Implements mechanisms to maintain stable network activity, either by regulating firing rates or membrane voltage.
      * **`numenta`**: Components from Numenta's Thousand Brains Theory and HTM research.
          * `grid_cells`: Hexagonal firing patterns for allocentric reference frames, plus displacement cells for movement encoding.
          * `active_dendrites`: NMDA-based dendritic computation with segment-based learning, contextual prediction, and dendritic spikes.
          * `sequence_memory`: HTM Temporal Memory for learning and predicting sequences of sparse patterns.
          * `spatial_pooler`: HTM Spatial Pooler for encoding inputs as stable sparse distributed representations with homeostatic boosting.
          * `sdr`: Sparse Distributed Representation operations including overlap, union, intersection, encoding, and classification.
          * `predictive_coding`: Prediction and error units, precision weighting, and free energy tracking. 
  * **`synapses`**: Defines the behavior of synapses.
      * `dendrites`: Determines how pre-synaptic spikes are converted into post-synaptic current for various connection types (e.g., `SimpleDendriticInput`, `Conv2dDendriticInput`). 
      * `learning`: Implements synaptic plasticity rules like STDP and RSTDP.  These rules modify synaptic weights based on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes, and in the case of RSTDP, a global reward signal (dopamine).
      * `specs`: Includes essential synaptic mechanisms like weight initialization, spike catching, and calculating spike traces used in learning rules.
      * **`numenta.predictive`**: Feedback prediction, feedforward error, and lateral context connections for predictive coding. 

### `conex.nn`

This module provides the tools to construct and manage the network architecture.

  * **`structure`**: Contains classes for building the network.
      * `Neocortex`: The main network class that holds all other structures. 
      * `Container`: A base class for creating hierarchical network objects that contain other objects. 
      * `Port`: An interface for connecting different network structures in a modular way. 
      * `Layer` / `CorticalLayer`: A container for neuron groups (e.g., excitatory and inhibitory populations) and their local connections. 
      * `CorticalColumn`: A container that groups multiple `CorticalLayer` objects to form a column-like structure. 
      * `Synapsis`: A structure that connects two `Ports`, automatically creating the required `SynapseGroup` objects between them. 
      * `InputLayer` / `OutputLayer`: Specialized layers for interfacing with data.
      * **`numenta.predictive_hierarchy`**: `PredictiveHierarchy` for multi-level predictive coding networks and `PredictiveCorticalColumn` for the canonical L4/L2-3/L5/L6 microcircuit. 
  * **`utils`**: Provides utilities for network management.
      * `replication`: Functions to save, load, and replicate network structures, enabling easy reuse of complex architectures.
      * `precision`: Mixed precision helpers for running parts of a network in float16 or bfloat16. 

### `conex.helpers`

This module contains utilities to assist with data preparation and processing.

  * **`transforms`**:
      * `encoders`: Functions to convert raw data (like images) into spike trains, such as `Poisson` and `Intensity2Latency` encoding. 
      * `masks`: Transformers that can occlude or isolate parts of an input, useful for attention experiments. 
  * **`filters`**: Implementations of common visual filters like Difference of Gaussians (`DoGFilter`) and `GaborFilter`.

## Thousand Brains Theory Support

CoNeX implements key components from Jeff Hawkins' **Thousand Brains Theory** and Numenta's **Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)** research. These components enable building brain-like systems that learn through movement, use reference frames, and reach consensus across multiple models.

### Key Components

All of these live under a `numenta` subpackage, so they stay grouped and clearly
separated from CoNeX's core behaviors.

| Component | Module | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Grid Cells** | `neurons.numenta.grid_cells` | Hexagonal firing patterns for allocentric (world-centered) reference frames |
| **Displacement Cells** | `neurons.numenta.grid_cells` | Encode movements between locations for learning object structure |
| **Active Dendrites** | `neurons.numenta.active_dendrites` | NMDA-based dendritic segments with nonlinear integration and contextual prediction |
| **Temporal Memory** | `neurons.numenta.sequence_memory` | HTM sequence learning algorithm with predictive cells and burst detection |
| **Spatial Pooler** | `neurons.numenta.spatial_pooler` | SDR encoding with competitive learning and homeostatic boosting |
| **SDR Operations** | `neurons.numenta.sdr` | Overlap, union, intersection, encoding, and classification for sparse patterns |
| **Column Voting** | `network.numenta.voting` | Inter-column consensus mechanism for object recognition |
| **Predictive Coding** | `neurons.numenta.predictive_coding` | Prediction and error units, precision weighting, free energy tracking |
| **Predictive Synapses** | `synapses.numenta.predictive` | Feedback prediction, feedforward error and lateral context connections |
| **Predictive Hierarchy** | `nn.structure.numenta.predictive_hierarchy` | Multi-level hierarchy builder and canonical cortical microcircuit |

Runnable examples are in [`Example/numenta/`](Example/numenta/).

### Example: Using Grid Cells

```python
from conex.behaviors.neurons import GridCellModule
from pymonntorch import Network, NeuronGroup

net = Network(behavior={}, dtype=torch.float32, device="cpu")

# Create a grid cell population with 4 modules
neurons = NeuronGroup(
    net=net,
    size=400,
    behavior={
        1: GridCellModule(
            n_modules=4,
            cells_per_module=100,
            scales=[40.0, 50.0, 70.0, 100.0],
        )
    },
    tag="grid_cells"
)
net.initialize()

# Encode a position
position = torch.tensor([50.0, 50.0])
activation = neurons.grid_cell_module.encode_position(neurons, position)
```

### Example: Using Temporal Memory

```python
from conex.behaviors.neurons import TemporalMemory, TemporalMemoryConfig

config = TemporalMemoryConfig(
    n_columns=2048,
    cells_per_column=32,
    activation_threshold=13,
)

neurons = NeuronGroup(
    net=net,
    size=2048 * 32,
    behavior={1: TemporalMemory(config=config)},
    tag="temporal_memory"
)
net.initialize()

# Process a sequence of sparse column activations
for active_columns in sequence:
    neurons.temporal_memory.compute(neurons, active_columns, learn=True)
```

### Building a Simple Network

Here's a conceptual example of how to build a network with an input layer and a cortical column, inspired by the project's examples. 

```python
import torch
from pymonntorch import NeuronGroup, NeuronDimension
from conex import Neocortex, InputLayer, CorticalLayer, CorticalColumn, Synapsis, Port, prioritize_behaviors
from conex.behaviors.neurons import LIF, NeuronAxon, SimpleDendriteStructure
from conex.behaviors.synapses import WeightInitializer, SimpleDendriticInput, PreSpikeCatcher, SynapseInit
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# 1. Initialize the Neocortex (the main network object)
net = Neocortex(dt=1.0, device="cpu", dtype=torch.float32)

# Dummy dataloader for the example
dummy_dataloader = DataLoader([torch.rand(28, 28) for _ in range(10)])

# 2. Create an Input Layer to feed data into the network
input_layer = InputLayer(
    net=net,
    input_dataloader=dummy_dataloader,
    sensory_size=NeuronDimension(height=28, width=28),
    instance_duration=30, # ms
    output_ports={"data_out": (None, [("sensory_pop", {})])},
)

# 3. Create a Cortical Layer
# Define an excitatory population of neurons
exc_neurons = NeuronGroup(
    net=net,
    size=100,
    behavior=prioritize_behaviors([
        LIF(R=5.0, tau=10.0, threshold=-50.0, v_reset=-70.0, v_rest=-65.0),
        NeuronAxon(),
        SimpleDendriteStructure(),
    ]),
)

# Create the layer itself, defining its input port
my_layer = CorticalLayer(
    net=net,
    excitatory_neurongroup=exc_neurons,
    input_ports={"input": (None, [Port(object=exc_neurons, label=None)])},
)

# 4. Create a Cortical Column to house the layer
my_column = CorticalColumn(
    net=net,
    layers={"my_layer": my_layer},
    input_ports={"input": (None, [Port(object=my_layer, label="input")])},
)

# 5. Connect the Input Layer to the Cortical Column using Synapsis
# This will connect the 'data_out' port of the input to the 'input' port of the column
data_connection = Synapsis(
    net=net,
    src=input_layer,
    dst=my_column,
    input_port="data_out",
    output_port="input",
    synapsis_behavior=prioritize_behaviors([
        SynapseInit(),
        WeightInitializer(mode="random"),
        SimpleDendriticInput(current_coef=1.0),
        PreSpikeCatcher(),
    ]),
    synaptic_tag="Proximal",
)

# 6. Initialize and run the simulation
net.initialize()
net.simulate_iterations(100) # Simulate for 100 timesteps

print("Simulation finished!")
```

### Defining a Custom Behavior

You can easily extend CoNeX with your own custom logic by creating new behavior classes. A behavior must inherit from `pymonntorch.Behavior` and can implement `initialize` and `forward` methods.

```python
from pymonntorch import Behavior
import torch

class MyCustomNeuronBehavior(Behavior):
    """A custom behavior that adds a random voltage boost to neurons on every step."""

    def initialize(self, neurons):
        # This method is called once when the network is initialized.
        # You can define parameters here.
        self.boost_strength = self.parameter("boost_strength", 1.0)
        print(f"Initialized MyCustomNeuronBehavior with boost_strength={self.boost_strength}")

    def forward(self, neurons):
        # This method is called on every simulation timestep.
        # 'neurons' is the NeuronGroup object this behavior is attached to.
        random_boost = torch.rand(neurons.size, device=neurons.device) * self.boost_strength
        neurons.v += random_boost

# How to use it:
# custom_behavior = MyCustomNeuronBehavior(boost_strength=0.5)
#
# my_neurons = NeuronGroup(
#     net=net,
#     size=100,
#     behavior={
#         ...
#         999: custom_behavior, # Add with a unique priority key
#     }
# )
```

## Project To-Dos and Future Work

The project has several areas marked for future improvement and development. Contributions in these areas are highly welcome\!

  * **Refactoring and Documentation:**
      * Add comprehensive docstrings for bound functions in learning rules. 
      * Consider refactoring behavior priority assignment to be a class property instead of using a dictionary. 
  * **Enhanced Neuron Models:**
      * Implement a multi-adaptation paradigm for LIF neurons. 
  * **Advanced Synaptic Dynamics:**
      * Improve the dendrite model to prevent priming of neurons that are already above their voltage threshold. 
      * Explore the effects of priming inhibitory neurons. 
  * **Optimization:**
      * Find a pure PyTorch alternative for `random.sample` in sparse weight initialization for better performance on GPU. 
  * **General Notes for Implementation:**
      * The `Payoff` behavior should be defined before the `Dopamine` behavior in the network's behavior dictionary. 
      * Many synaptic behaviors require that an `Axon` behavior is added to the pre-synaptic neuron group. 
      * Learning behaviors (`STDP`, etc.) often require `PreSpikeCatcher`, `PostSpikeCatcher`, `PreTrace`, and `PostTrace` to be present in the synapse's behaviors.
