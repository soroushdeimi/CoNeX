In the Thousand Brains Theory, each cortical column builds its own model of
objects. Columns communicate laterally to reach consensus on object identity
through a voting mechanism using sparse distributed representations (SDRs).

    Voting mechanism for inter-column consensus.
    
    Each cortical column casts "votes" for object identities based on its
    local observations. Columns share votes through lateral connections
    and iteratively converge to a consensus.
    
    The voting mechanism uses sparse distributed representations (SDRs):
    - Each column maintains a set of possible object representations
    - Votes are SDR patterns representing object hypotheses
    - Consensus is reached when columns agree on a common SDR
    
    Key properties of SDR voting:
    - Robust to noise (partial overlap still meaningful)
    - Allows uncertainty (multiple hypotheses)
    - Naturally handles novel vs. familiar objects
